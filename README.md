# Professional Scrum Developer Certification

The PSD certification is a simple certification for developers who want to prove theiry knowledge in Scrum. The assessment for this certification can be done ![here](https://www.scrum.org/assessments/professional-scrum-developer-certification). 

I once had a try, but failed. Thats why I opened this repository to provide others useful information about the assesment.
